This site is maintained by the 
[HarmonizedMRI](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI)
team, a group of MRI researchers dedicated to creating
open, vendor-agnostic MRI pulse sequences for functional imaging and other applications.
Our vision is to create portable and fully transparent protocols for
more reproducible MRI across space (sites) and time.

Funding is provided through an 
[NIH U24 grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Y22HpwtGJ0GsUA9J9iqWoQ/project-details/10306940)
for dissemination of portable fMRI sequences, and an
[NIH R01 grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Rc6iON3j_UieHv9Rbv10uQ/project-details/10704747)
to develop harmonized neuroimaging sequences for diffusion imaging and quantitative relaxation parameter mapping.
