Welcome to the HarmonizedMRI website! We are a dedicated team of MRI researchers and developers working towards creating open, vendor-agnostic MRI pulse sequences to enhance functional imaging and other MRI applications.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to create portable and fully transparent protocols for more reproducible MRI across space (sites) and time. By developing standardized MRI pulse sequences, we aim to enable consistent and reliable imaging practices that can be easily adopted across various research sites and over extended periods.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide the MRI research community with tools that facilitate reproducibility and collaboration. We focus on developing MRI pulse sequences that are open and adaptable, ensuring they can be utilized across different MRI platforms and research workflows.

## Funding and Support

Our work is supported by several key grants:

- **NIH U24 Grant**: Funding for the dissemination of portable fMRI sequences. [Learn more about the grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Y22HpwtGJ0GsUA9J9iqWoQ/project-details/10306940)
- **NIH R01 Grant**: Funding to develop harmonized neuroimaging sequences for diffusion imaging and quantitative relaxation parameter mapping. [Learn more about the grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Rc6iON3j_UieHv9Rbv10uQ/project-details/10704747)

## What We Do

### Open MRI Pulse Sequences
We create and share MRI pulse sequences that can be used across different MRI platforms, including Siemens, GE, and Philips. Our goal is to make it easier for researchers to replicate studies and build upon each other's work.

### Functional Imaging
Our sequences are designed for functional imaging applications, including fMRI, diffusion imaging, and quantitative relaxation parameter mapping. We aim to provide tools that can be seamlessly integrated into various research workflows.

### Community Engagement
We encourage collaboration and feedback from the MRI research community. Please feel free to reach out through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI) or participate in discussions to share your insights and suggestions.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate with us, please contact us via [email](mailto:contact@harmonizedmri.org) or through our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI/HarmonizedMRI/issues).

Thank you for visiting our site, and we look forward to advancing MRI research together!
