It is a high-resolution multi-shot readout-segmented EPI sequence with shot-to-shot phase fluctuations estimated from overlapped k-space regions between segments, instead of relying on external 2D navigators. The scripts include Pulseq sequence generation, example data, and reconstruction script, all in MATLAB. I aim to have a associated link available for the ISMRM diffusion workshop 2025 (ddl. submission Dec 6th 2024), and later a few modifications are expected to improve its user-friendliness.",/assets/logos/High-resolution_multi-shot_readout-segmented_EPI_.png,False
