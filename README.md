## Harmonized MRI: Vendor-agnostic MRI protocols

Welcome to the **Harmonized MRI** project, where we create open, vendor-independent
MRI pulse sequences for functional imaging and other applications.
Our vision is to create portable and fully transparent protocols for
more reproducible MRI across space (sites) and time.

The underlying acquisition technology is based on the [Pulseq](http://pulseq.github.io/) MR pulse sequence format 
and a [related framework](https://toppemri.github.io/), 
that together make it possible to execute the same MR pulse sequence across multiple vendors
(at present, Siemens and GE are supported).

Funding for this project is provided through an 
[NIH U24 grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Y22HpwtGJ0GsUA9J9iqWoQ/project-details/10306940)
for dissemination of portable fMRI sequences.

Code development is currently underway, and is hosted at
[https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI).
