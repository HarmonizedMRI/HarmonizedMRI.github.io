## Harmonized MRI: Vendor-agnostic MRI protocols

Welcome to the **Harmonized MRI** project, where we create open, vendor-independent
MRI pulse sequences for functional imaging and other applications.
Our vision is to create portable and fully transparent protocols for
more reproducible MRI across space (sites) and time.
This project is just getting started, so look for more content here in the future!

The underlying acquisition technology is based on the [Pulseq](http://pulseq.github.io/) 
MR pulse sequence file format and a [related software framework](https://toppemri.github.io/), 
that together make it possible to execute the same MR pulse sequence across multiple vendors
(at present, Siemens and GE are supported).

Code development is currently underway, and is hosted at
[https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI).
All code for this project is fully open source.

**Now recruiting early adopters!**

We also welcome you to post your questions at our
[User Forum](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI/UserForum/discussions).

Funding for this project is provided through an 
[NIH U24 grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Y22HpwtGJ0GsUA9J9iqWoQ/project-details/10306940)
for dissemination of portable fMRI sequences.
